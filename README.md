## Content
Here you find the presentation used in the classes, three Jupyter Notebooks and input data to run WOFOST.

In the notebooks we introduce:

* Basic data types and structures
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [WOFOST](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/research-institutes/environmental-research/facilities-tools/software-models-and-databases/wofost.htm) 

The first two notebooks cover the basic structures and packages for python and will be covered on the first class (24.11.2022). The third notebook, that presents the WOFOST model will be covered on the second class (01.12.2022).
