# Introduction to Python 

This directory contains the notebooks and supplementary materials used in the course **Naurgefahren: Prozesse und Katastrophenmanagement** from the Fachgebiet Ã–kohydrologie & Landschaftsbewertung

## Content
Here you find the presentation used in the classes, three Jupyter Notebooks and input data to run WOFOST.

In the notebooks we introduce:

* Basic data types and structures
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [WOFOST](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/research-institutes/environmental-research/facilities-tools/software-models-and-databases/wofost.htm) 

The first two notebooks cover the basic structures and packages for python and will be covered on the first class (24.11.2022). The third notebook, that presents the WOFOST model will be covered on the second class (01.12.2022).

## Anaconda installation

If you had a problem with anaconda or running jupyter notebooks you can try following these two links:

1. add anaconda/python to path names: [youtube.com/watch?v=HyxR0QTTJJs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyxR0QTTJJs)
2. install anaconda: [youtube.com/watch?v=HcPStPCFgW4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcPStPCFgW4)

The first shows how to add the python distribution from anaconda to your PATH. The second shows a step-by-step of the installation process on Windows.
